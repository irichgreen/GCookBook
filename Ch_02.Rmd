This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gcookbook)
library(xlsx)       #.xlsx data read
library(gdata)      #.xls data read
library(foreign)    # SPSS, SAS, MATLAB

summary(mtcars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
qplot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
qplot(wt, mpg, data=mtcars)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
